## Experience

Over the years I've worked mainly on Software Engineering and Systems Administration.

### OpenNebula, Spain — Cloud Engineer

> JUNE 2018 - PRESENT

I’m involved in several aspects of the company business including: Software Development, Customer Support, Community interaction, Infrastructure and external projects. I write software, then the corresponding tests and the documentation. Occasionally I write Knowledge Base articles and blog posts about certain features, use cases or best practices.

### Ministerio de Agricultura de Cuba (MINAG), Havana — Systems and Network Engineer

> July 2018 – December 2018

MINAG's Data Center and IT services faced a crisis due to a long history of continuously stacked errors and bad administration practices. My job was to stabilize the infrastructure layer, then the IT side by diagnosing the whole enterprise network. Then secure all of the network-related components and support customers for a period of time.

### Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana, Havana — College Assistant Professor

> SEPTEMBER 2017 - AUGUST 2018

I supported the lead professors on these subjects:
Operating Systems
Network Simulation
I also researched about Cloud Computing oriented topics

### Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana, Havana — Systems and Network Engineer

> SEPTEMBER 2016 - AUGUST 2018

I managed the data-center infrastructure on hardware and software level using cloud platforms. Also deployed and supported user-facing and support IT services.

### Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana, Havana — Laboratory Professor

> March 2015 – May 2015

I assisted the professors teaching the subject of Simulation Tools during the laboratory based lessons.

## Education

### Universidad Tecnológica de La Habana, Havana — Telecommunications Engineer

> SEPTEMBER 2012 - JUNE 2017

  <a href="https://www.cujae.edu.cu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    <img src="https://cujae.edu.cu/images/sin-genrico-cuadrado.png" alt="cujae" width="140" height="180" />
  </a>

I assisted professors teaching Simulation Tools as an auxiliary student during 3rd year. During the 4th year I changed my study programs to Telematics due to working along with MsC. Lilia Rosa García Perellada on her PHD.  I wrote a diploma thesis about Cloud Computing for SMEs.

## Projects

Complementary to my job I've participated in numerous projects involving different industries. These projects are the result of my passion for different topics, like gaming, education and computer science.

### Content  Creation — Escape from Tarkov

  </a>

One of the most hardcore FPS  games with influence from MMOS, Looter Shooters and survival. It’s my favorite game and I created a YouTube channel with educational content. Also sporadic streams on Twitch and a Discord Server for my community.

  </a>

Skyrim is one of the most popular RPGs ever created. I’ve created mods focusing on enhancing immersion or adding quality of life.

### LXDoNe — Linux Containers for OpenNebula

  <a href="https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-lxdone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenNebula/addon-lxdone/master/picts/LXDoNe-logo-final.png" alt="lxdone"/>
  </a>

LXDoNe is an addon for OpenNebula to manage LXD Containers. It fits in the Virtualization and Monitorization Driver section according to OpenNebula's Architecture. It uses the pylxd API for several container tasks. This addon is the continuation of LXCoNe, an addon for LXC. Check the blog entry in OpenNebula official site.

### CloX — Your cloud in a box

CloX is a solution for small companies, enabling them to easily and cheaply deploy their Private Clouds and stop depending on Public Clouds. It is based on OpenNebula and LXD, so you can expect an easy to use, fully featured cloud orchestrator with minimum overhead, great performance and reduced deployment times. CloX is meant to be deployed over Single Board Computers (SBCs) based on ARM processors providing low capital expenses and power consumption.

## Publications

Although not the focus of my career, I've written some articles showcasing some of the projects.

### OpenNebula's LXD driver development, Barcelona — HPCKP’ 2018

> June 2018

Operating-System-Level Virtualization is an emerging technology, capable of delivering superior performance
and scalability values compared to other mechanisms such as Hardware-Assisted Virtualization. It is currently making its way into cloud infrastructures, where infrastructure service providers such as Amazon already provide container-based services on virtual machines with solutions such as Docker or LXC-inspired proprietaries such as Kubernetes from the google container engine. Few, like Joyent, provide infrastructure as a service on a bare-metal container platform, on which the advantages of Operating-System-Level Virtualization can be exploited to the maximum. However, in private clouds, infrastructure managers such as OpenStack and CloudStack, provide little support, null, or third parties. OpenNebula has already been enriched with the integration of LXC. However, LXD is a very recent technology that acts as an interface over LXC allowing greater functionality, usability and security. This is why the objective outlined in the present work was the development of a driver for OpenNebula, which would allow it to support LXD. The developed driver supports different functionalities like deploying containers on file systems and distributed storage; add / remove network interfaces and disks to contenders; and limit the use of resources between containers.

### METHODOLOGY FOR SIZING COMPUTE RESOURCES FOR SME OVER PRIVATE CLOUD, Havana — Informática 2018

> March 2018

Designing a private cloud should be rooted in business objectives, limitations, and technical needs. Unfortunately, both academic and industrial literature often overlooks the business perspective when discussing cloud design and management. There is also a lack of structured methods for key decisions like service dimensioning, choosing a virtualization platform, server types, and cloud managers. This gap can lead to issues in performance, availability, and cost-effectiveness. The work proposes a procedure to remedy these shortcomings, particularly for small and medium enterprises. By aligning cloud design with business objectives and using general-purpose hardware and open-source software, the approach aims to positively impact capital investment, data center operations, and technological independence.
